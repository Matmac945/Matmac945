### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm  Matias a Data Scientist currently in working in NLP related projects!.
My background is in interactive experiences and music production. 
Lately I've been focused in more _"technical"_ focused projects, but one of my biggest passions is building tools and systems for creation of art and collaboration between computers and humans. ðŸ¤–
